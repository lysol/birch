DESIGN

Games can be created and placed in examples/. The design of the engine expects a procedural approach,
with chunks being seeded as needed when the view is scrolled. Implementing a seed_handler method and registering
it with the engine is the way forward here.

Game loop logic is placed in a "tick handler", which is not a zookeeper who deals with arachnids.

Package builds should be ok now. Run `python3 setup.py install`, then any of the examples, such as `python3 -m birch.examples.scamcity.__init__`.
