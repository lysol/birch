DESIGN

Games can be created and placed in examples/. The design of the engine expects a procedural approach,
with chunks being seeded as needed when the view is scrolled. Implementing a seed_handler method and registering
it with the engine is the way forward here.

Game loop logic is placed in a "tick handler", which is not a zookeeper who deals with arachnids.

Running games is goofy as oh heck jeez right now, just do python3 setup.py install, go to build/lib.linux-whatever,
then run
python3 -m birch.examples.bristol.__init__

for example
